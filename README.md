# Test project for fixed update

## Usage

Test the game by running it and touch anywhere on the screen. Depending on your computer/mobile, the player will stutter a bit while moving forward.

Now open touch_controller.script and change fixed_update to update and see the difference in stuttering.

Not sure if it's related to fixed_update or some performence issue overall in my code.
